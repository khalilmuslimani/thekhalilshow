              <h3>Project 1: File/Directory Processing</h3>
              <h5><i>Written with Java in Eclipse</i></h5>
              <p>The purpose of this project was to implement a program for file/directory processing.
               This is a simple menu based program, with options ranging form 0-7 and only a console
              based interface. The user must enter an abosolute directory name, with from which they
             can perform actions with. This includes listing first level directory contents, all level
            directory contents, delete file, encrypt file, decrypt file, and exit. Check out the source
           code below for the actual implementation.</p>

              <h3>Project 2: Use Three.js to Create a Unique 3-D Animated Scene</h3>
              <h5><i>Written with HTML and JavaScript in Visual Studio 2017</i></h5>
              <p>The purpose of this project was to use HTML and JavaScript, specifically Three.js to
               create a unique 3-D animated scene. This was especially difficult for me, because prior to
              completing this project I had no prior experience in graphic animation, let alone Three.js.
             As you can see this animated scene is not very intuitive, but does include its own lighting,
            cameras, and action buttons that controls the animation of various objects within the scene.
           Check out the animation below, and feel free to inspect it and look at the source code if
           your browser allows for it.</p>

              <h3>Project 3: Customer Contact Manager</h3>
              <h5><i>Written with Java in Eclipse</i></h5>
              <p>This is a project I did early on in 2015, not for any course but just for me to work on
               to get a better handle on the basics of java. This application is also console based and
              allows the user store customer information, and add and delete customers as necessary. Check out
            the source code for yourself, which consists of 5 seperate classes.</p>
