          <p>Hello friends, my name is Abraham Khalil Muslimani, but I prefer to go by Khalil. I have decided to make this website for several reasons, but mainly to give myself
             a platform where I can show my passion for computer science. Specifically, a place I can show off what I have learned while pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science
             at the University of Maryland University College.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">When I was a kid my three brothers and I were introduced to web development.
          We would get paid to set up desktop personal computers out of the box and install all of the installation cds that used to come with equipment.
          I did not know much other than where to plug each connection, how to power on the machine, and when to click next and finish through each of the installation prompts.
          Secondly, he played on our childhood love for Dragon Ball Z and set us up with a website called MuzKids.com, a site I wish was still being hosted today. Any way, we learned how to
          steal gifs from the internet and copy them to our website. This did not seem like work to us, more like a video game. As I grew older I strayed from this exposure,
         but always knew I would come back to it. I realized I needed to follow my pasion and get back to my passion of creating code and content on the web, so I enrolled in to UMUC to get my Bachelors in Computer Science. I am currently
         in my last stretch of 7 courses to graduate, which if all goes to plan will be this December of 2019! I hope that this site will serve as a means to show others who have a similar
         story that they too can chase thier dreams no matter what point in thier life that they may be in. I hope you enjoy what you see and thanks for visiting.</p>
